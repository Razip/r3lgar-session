KISS and simple session manager powered by shell scripts

Usage as simple as

    go get github.com/derlaft/r3lgar-session && $GOPATH/bin/r3lgar-session path-to-shitscripts

Example shitscript (should be in path-to-shitscripts and end with '.sh'):

    #!/bin/sh
    # well, shebang is kinda ignored
    exec macro --replace
    # restarts are handled
    # kills of manager process -- to
    # enjoy
